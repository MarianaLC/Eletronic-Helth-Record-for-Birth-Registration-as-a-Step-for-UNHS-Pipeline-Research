# Eletronic-Helth-Record-for-Birth-Registration-as-a-Step-for-UNHS-Pipeline-Research
The UNHS provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the potential for quality of care improvement with EHR implementation, because within the context of UNHS, there is a series of information that must be recorded, namely data related to pregnancy, birth and the newborn, the identification of risk factors for deafness and the results of the Apgar score. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an archetype of an EHR for birth registration, using openEHR specifications, as a step of a UNHS pipeline research.
